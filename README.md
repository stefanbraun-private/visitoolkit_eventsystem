# visitoolkit_eventsystem
minimalistic event system  

**Installation via pip**   
https://pypi.org/project/visitoolkit-eventsystem   
*(runs on Python 3)*  


## description
Registered handlers (a bag of handlers) getting called when event gets fired  
using ideas from "axel events" https://github.com/axel-events/axel  
and "event system" from http://www.valuedlessons.com/2008/04/events-in-python.html

## usage
    import visitoolkit_eventsystem.eventsystem as eventsystem

    # handlers are callback functions in your code,
    # when firing an event visitoolkit_eventsystem will call them with the given argument(s)
    def cb1(event_id, *arg, **args):
        if event_id > 0:
            # handle event...
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # Default is synchronous execution of handlers (blocking main thread, collecting all results)
    # sync_mode=False means asynchronous execution of handlers (one background thread calls all handlers) 
    # =>Details about flag "exc_info"(default is True): https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info
    # =>Flag "traceback" (default is False) controls verbosity of error_info when an exception occurred
    es = eventsystem.EventSystem(sync_mode=True)
    
    # adding or removing handlers in list-like syntax
    es += cb1

    #The execution result is returned as a list containing all results per handler having this structure:
    #  exec_result = [
    #      (True, result, handler),        # on success
    #      (False, error_info, handler),   # on error
    #      (None, None, handler), ...      # asynchronous execution
    #  ]

    # firing event
    result = es(42)
